  /*
   * RLE compression offers efficient on-the-fly encoding and decoding of strings.
   * The idea is simple: encode successive repeated characters by the repetition count and the character.
   *
   * For example, the encoding of aaaabbbcdd is 4a3b1c2d. The decoding of 3f5x2g is fffxxxxxgg.
   *
   * Implement run length encoding and decoding functions.
   * Assume the strings to be letters of the alphabet and the string to be decoded is a valid encoded string.
